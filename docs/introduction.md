  The goal of this project is to share with my experience how I configured quite some stack of technologies together.
With some of them I have quite extensive experience (like React, Ramda, Gulp, Webpack), 
with others — I’ve touched them a bit (TypeScript, GraphQL) — so I know the context and the idea but no deep background
in that and some of them I just heard names but never yet had a chance to have a hands-on experience 
(Apollo Client, Material UI).

  And the intention is even a bit broader. To create an open source WebStore which can be highly customisable, 
this is related to UI, services, databases, integration layers, localisation, etc. So it shouldn’t be any boundary to 
make some modules work with completely another ecosystem.

   Why I’m personally need it? Cause I’m really enthusiastic about it. I think that I have enough potential and skills
to make it fly. I’d be more than happy to create a community around it as I’m enjoying to communicate with people,
share my own knowledge and learn new things from others.

   Why I find exactly this project interesting for myself? We are more and more buying things online, whatever it be.
That’s really convenient way to do it. So having the business related to a selling something and having no site 
for that makes you do the business harder or even puts you out of the game. I’d like to give yet another opportunity
to make life easier for such people in that respect. Of course they always can go to a paid version, but my intention 
to give an opportunity to choose and decide upon given choices.
