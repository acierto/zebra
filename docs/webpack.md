To create a bundle for frontend we use Webpack. 
Configuration is located in ```gulp/tasks/webpack.js```. 
There are 2 configuration, one for development and another for development environment. 
The biggest difference is that for production the code is minimised and webpack dev server client is not running. 
Itâ€™s used only in development to be able to get hot-reloading feature.
